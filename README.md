# ReactionTimeTester

##Author

##Description 
This is a program that allows you to see what your reaction time is.
It was written to explore more functions of c# including double buffering,
system timer, and stopwatch.

##Known Issues
The results appeared to have an offset / inaccurace of ~100ms, so as a temporary compensation the program will subtract 100 from the result.
